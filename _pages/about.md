I am a Ph.D. student at the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University advised by [Professor Yunan Yang](https://as.cornell.edu/people/yunan-yang). My research is supported by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) and broadly focuses on inverse problems for dynamical systems, such as parameter estimation, state reconstruction, and the interpolation of stochastic processes. Before arriving at Cornell, I previously earned B.A.s in Mathematics and Physics at Amherst College, where I was advised by [Professor Ryan J. Alvarado](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/rjalvarado).

**Generative Modeling of Time-Dependent Densities via Optimal Transport and Projection Pursuit**

*Collaborators: Yunan Yang (Cornell University) and Romit Maulik (Pennsylvania State University & Argonne National Laboratory)*

Deep learning algorithms for generative modeling of time-dependent data may face difficulties related to optimal
hyperparameter selection and can be computationally expensive. In this work, we instead propose using a
generative model based on numerical linear algebra and projection pursuit optimal transport, which requires
only a few hyperparameter choices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on synthetic data of stochastic
dynamical systems and real-life examples of fish schooling and embryoid growth. These experiments show that
our proposed approach is highly competitive with a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm that learns to sample
from time-dependent densities in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability.
