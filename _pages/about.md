I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) at Cornell University advised by [Professor Yunan Yang](https://as.cornell.edu/people/yunan-yang). My research focuses on developing robust data-driven methods for modeling dynamical systems under challenging assumptions, e.g., noise, chaos, uncertainty, sparsity, and partial observability. To accomodate these data-scenarios I adopt a probabilistic perspective throughout my work and make frequent use of tools from optimal transport, ergodic theory, and machine learning. 

My research was previously supported by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/). During the Summer of 2024, I interned at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, where I worked with [Dr. Saviz Mowlavi](https://www.merl.com/people/mowlavi) and [Dr. Mouhacine Benosman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cs7AJxcAAAAJ&hl=en) on accelerating the convergence of physics-informed neural networks for solving complex time-dependent partial differential equations. I was previously a 2022 [National Science Foundation, Mathematical Sciences Graduate Intern](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nsf-mathematical-sciences-graduate-internship) and a [Visiting Graduate Student at Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/education/visiting-student-program-for-graduate-students), where I worked on deep learning for stochastic dynamical systems with [Professor Romit Maulik](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/rmm7011). Before arriving at Cornell, I earned B.A.s in [Mathematics](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics) and [Physics](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/physics) at Amherst College in 2021.
