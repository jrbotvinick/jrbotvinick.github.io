I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University advised by [Professor Yunan Yang](https://as.cornell.edu/people/yunan-yang). My research is supported by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) and broadly focuses on computational inverse problems for dynamical systems, such as parameter estimation and attractor reconstruction. Before arriving at Cornell, I previously earned B.A.s in Mathematics and Physics at Amherst College in 2021, where I was advised by [Professor Ryan J. Alvarado](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/rjalvarado). Please feel free to reach out to me at jrb482@cornell.edu. [Here is my CV.](https://github.com/jrbotvinick/jrbotvinick.github.io/files/13453717/JBotvinickGreenhouseCV.pdf)


Research Interests
====
My research interests are in dynamical systems, ergodic theory, optimal transport, numerical analysis, inverse problems, and machine learning.
