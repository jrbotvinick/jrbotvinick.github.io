I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) at Cornell University advised by [Professor Yunan Yang](https://as.cornell.edu/people/yunan-yang). My research focuses on developing robust data-driven methods for modeling dynamical systems under challenging conditions, such as noise, chaos, uncertainty, sparsity, and partial observability. To accommodate these data scenarios, I adopt a measure-centric perspective throughout my work and make frequent use of tools from optimal transport, ergodic theory, time-delay embedding, and machine learning. My Ph.D. research has been partially supported by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) (Sep. 2022 - Aug. 2025). Before arriving at Cornell, I earned B.A.s in [Mathematics](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics) and [Physics](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/physics) at Amherst College in 2021. Please feel free to reach out to me at ```jrb482@cornell.edu```.
