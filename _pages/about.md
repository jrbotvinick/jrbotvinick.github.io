I am a Ph.D. student at the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell University advised by [Professor Yunan Yang](https://as.cornell.edu/people/yunan-yang). My research is supported by an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) and broadly focuses on inverse problems for dynamical systems, such as parameter estimation, state reconstruction, and the interpolation of stochastic processes. Before arriving at Cornell, I previously earned B.A.s in Mathematics and Physics at Amherst College, where I was advised by [Professor Ryan J. Alvarado](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/rjalvarado).

Research Interests
====
My research interests are in dynamical systems, ergodic theory, optimal transport, numerical analysis, inverse problems, and machine learning.
