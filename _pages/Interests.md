Outside of research, I enjoy [juggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJPTU0EOcd0&t=2s), [playing the cello](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H5a3ELpYbDP4a6sDeMoDpa2EkazbzppD/view?usp=sharing), [composing music](https://musescore.com/user/2623006), and playing ultimate. I have been juggling since I was ten years old, love traveling to various festivals/competitions around the world to train with and meet other jugglers, and also hold various [world records](https://juggle.fandom.com/wiki/Jonah_Botvinick-Greenhouse). I have previously volunteered with [Juggling Life](http://www.jugglinglifeinc.org/), which is a nonprofit organization that teaches and performs juggling, and I am presently a member of the [Cornell Juggling Club](https://cornell.campusgroups.com/jugglingclub/home/).
